              Hello! I'm Simrika Sunar, a dedicated student currently pursuing my Grade 12 education at 
              Adarsha Secondary School. I have successfully completed my SEE (Secondary Education Examination) 
              from the same institution with excellent results.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am passionate about computer engineering and technology. My journey in programming and 
              web development has equipped me with various skills and technologies that I continue to 
              expand upon every day. I love solving problems through code and creating user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to take on new challenges in the 
              field of technology and software development. My goal is to become a skilled computer engineer 
              and contribute to innovative technological solutions.
